                    This project focused on analyzing the change in relationships between different countries before and after COVID-19. It covered statistical knowledge, machine learning (Apriori Algorithm), and cluster computing. 
                    The script was written using Python and ran on the Google Cloud Platform. In the script, SQL language was used to extract the data from the GDLET2.0 database and transformed it into the required format. 
                    After the script was completed, the script was delivered to several clusters and ran to handle the bunch of data computing in parallel.

                    Two computer graphic projects are developed through the C++ programming language and the OpenGL 3 & 4 framework. 
                    The Snowpiercer project used OpenGL 3 to produce a 3D animation. The perspective in the animation is controllable and the train runs on a pre-designed track. 
                    The Aquarium project was mainly developed by using new features of OpenGL 4 about light and shadow.
