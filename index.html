                    This is my part-time job in my own free time, as an independent software developer, co-contracting with a friend to create Android software for a client. The project uses but is not limited to JavaScript, Python, C, HTML, and other languages. The project is based on the QT framework, and the final product is standalone software that can be used on Android phones or tablets.
